We initialize a variable prev to None. This variable will be used to keep track of the previous node as we reverse the links between nodes.

We enter a while loop that continues as long as head is not None. This loop iterates through the linked list, reversing the links.

Inside the loop:

We reverse the direction of the next pointer of the current head node to point to the prev node. This effectively changes the direction of the link from the current node to the previous node, reversing the order of nodes.

We then update the prev variable to be the current head node, as it will become the previous node in the next iteration.

Finally, we move head to the next node in the original list. This is done by assigning head.next to head, effectively advancing head to the next node.

After the loop, the prev variable will be pointing to the new head of the reversed linked list. This is because, during the loop, prev gradually moves to the end of the original list, and when the loop exits, it will be at the end, which is now the beginning of the reversed list.

We return prev as the new head of the reversed list.

In summary, this code iteratively reverses the linked list by modifying the next pointers of each node in the list while keeping track of the previous node (prev). This results in a reversal of the original linked list. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list, as it processes each node once.â€‹

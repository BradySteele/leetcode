Initialize Dictionary (num_indices = {}):

Initializes an empty dictionary named num_indices.
This dictionary will store each number encountered along with its index in the nums array.

Loop Through Array (for i, num in enumerate(nums):):

Initiates a loop through the nums array using enumerate(nums).
i: Index of the current element.
num: Value of the current element.

Calculate Complement (complement = target - num):

Calculates the complement needed to achieve the target sum.
Subtracts the current num from the target.

Check for Complement in Dictionary (if complement in num_indices:):

Checks if the calculated complement exists as a key in the num_indices dictionary.

Return Indices (return [num_indices[complement], i]):

If the complement exists in num_indices, a pair of elements that sum up to the target has been found.
The function immediately returns a list containing the indices of these elements [num_indices[complement], i].

Store Current Number and Index (num_indices[num] = i):

If the complement doesn't exist in num_indices, the current num and its index i are stored in the num_indices dictionary.

Return Empty List (return []):

If the loop completes without finding a valid pair of indices that satisfy the condition, the function returns an empty list [].
This code uses a dictionary to track encountered numbers and their indices. It iterates through the array, calculates the complement for the target sum, and checks if that complement exists in the dictionary. If found, it returns the indices; if not, it adds the current number and its index to the dictionary. This approach has a time complexity of O(n) and efficiently solves the Two Sum problem.

Step 1: Function Definition

The hasPathSum function is defined within the Solution class. It takes two parameters: root (the root node of a binary tree) and targetSum (the desired sum for a path from root to leaf).

Step 2: Check for Empty Tree

If the root node is None, there's no tree to consider. The function immediately returns False.

Step 3: Check for Valid Path

The next check is whether the current node is a leaf node (both left and right children are None). Additionally, it checks if the value of the current node equals targetSum. If both conditions are met, it means the current path from root to this leaf node has the desired sum. In this case, the function returns True.

Step 4: Recursive Exploration

If the current node is not a leaf node, the function performs two recursive calls:
The first recursive call explores the left subtree of the current node. It subtracts the current node's value from targetSum to track the remaining sum needed to reach the target.
The second recursive call explores the right subtree of the current node in a similar manner.

Step 5: Combining Results

Finally, the function returns True if either the recursive call on the right subtree or the one on the left subtree (or both) returns True. This implies that either the right subtree or the left subtree (or both) has a valid path from root to leaf with the given sum.
By using recursion, the code explores all possible paths from the root to leaf nodes while updating the remaining sum needed to reach the target. If any valid path is found, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

e = x sets the variable e (end) to the value of x. This initializes the search range.

b = 0 initializes the variable b (beginning) to 0, marking the lower end of the search range.

result = x initializes result to the value of x. This will capture the largest integer square root found so far.

The while loop (b <= e): continues as long as the search range is valid, meaning b is less than or equal to e.

m = int(b + (e - b) // 2) calculates the middle value m of the search range using integer division. This sets up the "guess" for the integer square root.

The three conditions inside the loop handle the different cases:

If (m * m) == x, it means the integer square root is found, so you return m.

If (m * m) > x, the current guess m is too high, so you adjust the end of the search range by setting e = m - 1.

If (m * m) < x, the current guess m is too low or just right, so you update result with m (as it's a candidate for the largest integer square root found so far) and adjust the beginning of the search range by setting b = m + 1.

Once the loop exits, you return result, which contains the largest integer square root found.â€‹

zip(s, t) pairs up the characters from s and t element by element. For example, if s = "egg" and t = "add", zip(s, t) would produce [('e', 'a'), ('g', 'd'), ('g', 'd')]. It essentially creates a list of tuples where each tuple contains a character from s and its corresponding character from t.

set(zip(s, t)) converts this list of tuples into a set. Sets automatically remove duplicate elements, so this set will contain unique character pairs from s and t. Using the example above, set(zip(s, t)) would result in {('e', 'a'), ('g', 'd')}.

len(set(zip(s, t))) calculates the number of unique character pairs in the set. In our example, it would be 2 because there are two unique pairs: ('e', 'a') and ('g', 'd').

set(s) and set(t) convert the strings s and t into sets of unique characters. For s = "egg" and t = "add", set(s) would be {'e', 'g'} and set(t) would be {'a', 'd'}.

len(set(s)) and len(set(t)) calculate the number of unique characters in s and t. In our example, they would both be 2.

The line compares these three lengths: len(set(zip(s, t))), len(set(s)), and len(set(t)).

If all three lengths are equal, it means that the characters in s can be mapped to unique characters in t without violating the isomorphic condition. In this case, the function returns True, indicating that s and t are isomorphic.
If any of the lengths are different, it means that the isomorphic condition is not satisfied, and the function returns False.
So, in summary, this line of code checks that the unique character pairs created by pairing up characters from s and t are the same as the unique characters in s and t themselves, ensuring that the mapping is one-to-one and preserving the order of characters, which is the requirement for isomorphic strings.â€‹

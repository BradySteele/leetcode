Step 1: Function Definition

The code defines a function named hasCycle that takes one argument, head, which represents the head of a linked list.
It specifies that the function returns a boolean value (True or False).

Step 2: Initial Checks

The code first checks if head is None, which means there's no linked list. In this case, it immediately returns False because a cycle cannot exist without a linked list.
It also checks if head.next is None, which means there's only one node in the list. A cycle requires at least two nodes, so it returns False in this case as well.

Step 3: Initialize Pointers

Two pointers are initialized:
slow starts at the head of the linked list.
fast starts at the node immediately after the head (i.e., head.next).

Step 4: Cycle Detection Loop

A loop is set up that continues until the slow and fast pointers meet. This loop is essential for detecting a cycle and uses the Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm.

Step 5: Pointer Movement Inside the Loop

Within the loop:
It checks if fast or fast.next is None. If either is None, it means the fast pointer has reached the end of the list, indicating there is no cycle. In this case, it returns False.
It then updates the pointers:
slow moves one step forward by setting it to slow.next.
fast moves two steps forward by setting it to fast.next.next.

Step 6: Cycle Detected

If the loop exits (i.e., the slow and fast pointers meet), it means a cycle has been detected. In this case, the function returns True.
In summary, this code uses two pointers, slow and fast, to traverse the linked list. The fast pointer moves twice as fast as the slow pointer. If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer, and the function returns True. If there is no cycle, or if the linked list is empty or has only one node, it returns False.â€‹

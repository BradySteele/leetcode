Base Case for Empty Tree: If the root is None, indicating an empty tree, the minimum depth is 0. The function immediately returns 0.

Base Cases for Missing Subtrees: Next, the code handles the cases where either the left or the right subtree is missing. If the left subtree is missing (root.left is None), the function calculates the minimum depth of the right subtree using a recursive call to self.minDepth(root.right) and adds 1 to account for the depth of the current node. Similarly, if the right subtree is missing (root.right is None), the function calculates the minimum depth of the left subtree and adds 1.

Recursive Depth Calculation: If both left and right subtrees exist, the code calculates the minimum depth for both the left and right subtrees using recursive calls to self.minDepth.

Minimum Depth Calculation: After calculating the depths of the left and right subtrees, the code calculates the minimum depth between the two using the min function. This represents the minimum depth of the current subtree.

Adding 1 for Current Node: Finally, the code adds 1 to the calculated minimum depth. This accounts for the depth of the current node, resulting in the minimum depth of the entire tree rooted at the root node.

Returning Minimum Depth: The final result is the minimum depth of the binary tree, which the function returns as an integer.â€‹

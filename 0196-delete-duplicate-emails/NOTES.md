DELETE p1: This part of the query specifies that we want to delete rows from the table Person and assigns the alias p1 to the rows that will be deleted.

FROM Person p1: We specify the table Person and give it the alias p1, which we'll use for the rows that are going to be deleted.

JOIN Person p2 ON p1.Email = p2.Email AND p1.Id > p2.Id: We perform a self-join on the Person table, creating two aliases (p1 and p2) for it. This allows us to compare rows within the same table. We join rows where the email addresses match (p1.Email = p2.Email) and where the ID of p1 is greater than the ID of p2 (p1.Id > p2.Id). This effectively pairs up duplicate emails and ensures that we keep the row with the smallest ID.

The DELETE statement deletes the rows matched by the JOIN condition, which are the rows with duplicate emails except for the one with the smallest ID.

After running this SQL query, the Person table will have all duplicate emails removed, and only the rows with the smallest ID for each unique email will be retained.

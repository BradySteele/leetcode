Dictionary Mapping (charDict):

The charDict dictionary maps opening brackets to their corresponding closing brackets. For example, "(" maps to ")", "[" maps to "]", and "{" maps to "}".

Stack Initialization (stack = []):

The stack list will be used to keep track of the opening brackets encountered.

Loop Through Characters (for char in s:):

The loop iterates through each character in the input string s.

Opening Brackets Check (if char in charDict:):

If the current character char is found in the charDict, it means it's an opening bracket (i.e., "(", "[", or "{").
In this case, the opening bracket is pushed onto the stack using stack.append(char).

Closing Brackets Check (else):

If the current character char is not in the charDict, it means it's a closing bracket.
The code checks if the stack is empty or if the top opening bracket on the stack doesn't match the current closing bracket using charDict[stack.pop()] != char.
If either of these conditions is true, it means the string is not valid, so the function immediately returns False.

Final Check (return not stack):

After the loop completes, the function checks if the stack is empty.
If the stack is empty, it means all opening brackets have been correctly matched and closed, so the string is valid. In this case, the function returns True.
If the stack is not empty, there are unmatched opening brackets, so the string is not valid. The function returns False.
In essence, the code uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets encountered in the input string. When a closing bracket is encountered, it checks whether the corresponding opening bracket is at the top of the stack. If the brackets don't match or there are unmatched opening brackets, the string is not valid. Otherwise, if all opening brackets are correctly matched and closed, the string is valid. This approach efficiently ensures that the brackets are balanced and closed in the correct order.â€‹

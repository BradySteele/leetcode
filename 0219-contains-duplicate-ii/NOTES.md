â€‹Initialization of seen Dictionary: An empty dictionary called seen is created. This dictionary will be used to keep track of the most recent index where each number in the nums list is seen.

Loop Through the nums List: A for loop iterates through the nums list. The loop variable num represents the current element in the list, and i represents the index of that element.

Check for Duplicate Numbers and Index Difference: Inside the loop, it is checked if the current num is already present in the seen dictionary using the num in seen condition.

If it is present, the inner if statement checks if the absolute difference between the current index i and the previously seen index seen[num] is less than or equal to k. This checks whether the two occurrences of the same number are within the allowed range of indices.

If the condition is satisfied, True is returned because two distinct indices with the same number and a difference less than or equal to k have been found.

Update seen Dictionary: If the current num is not found in the seen dictionary or if the index difference condition is not satisfied, the seen dictionary is updated by setting seen[num] to the current index i. This keeps track of the most recent index where the num is seen.

Loop Completion: After the loop completes without finding any such pair of indices that satisfy the conditions, False is returned. This means that there are no duplicate numbers within a range of k indices in the nums list.

In summary, this code efficiently iterates through the nums list, keeps track of the most recent index where each number is seen using the seen dictionary, and checks for duplicate numbers with a valid index difference. If such a pair is found, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

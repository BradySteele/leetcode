int_a = int(a, 2) converts the binary string a to an integer using the int() function with base 2. This treats the binary string as a base-2 number and converts it to its integer representation.

int_b = int(b, 2) does the same for the binary string b.

sum_int = int_a + int_b adds the converted integers int_a and int_b to obtain the sum as an integer.

binary_sum = bin(sum_int)[2:] converts the integer sum back to a binary string using the bin() function. The result of bin(sum_int) is a string in the form '0b...', where ... represents the binary digits. The [2:] slicing is used to remove the first two characters ('0b').

Finally, return binary_sum returns the binary sum as a string.

result = [] initializes an empty list called result, which will store the individual binary digits of the sum.

carry = 0 initializes a variable called carry with a value of 0. This variable holds the carry value during binary addition.

i, j = len(a) - 1, len(b) - 1 initializes two pointers i and j to the rightmost indices of the binary strings a and b, respectively.

The while i >= 0 or j >= 0 or carry: loop iterates until there are no more digits to process in both strings and there's no carry left.

sum_ = carry initializes a variable sum_ with the current value of the carry. This will be used to calculate the sum of digits at the current positions in both strings and the carry.

The following if statements handle the addition of digits from a and b, if they are available:

If there are still digits left in string a, the current digit is added to sum_ using sum_ += int(a[i]). Then, the pointer i is decremented to move to the next digit in string a.

Similarly, if there are digits left in string b, the current digit is added to sum_ using sum_ += int(b[j]). Then, the pointer j is decremented to move to the next digit in string b.

result.append(str(sum_ % 2)) appends the current binary digit to the result list. The current binary digit is obtained by calculating the remainder of sum_ divided by 2 (sum_ % 2).

carry = sum_ // 2 calculates the new carry by performing integer division of sum_ by 2 (sum_ // 2). This gives the carry value for the next iteration of the loop.

return ''.join(result[::-1]) assembles the final binary sum by joining the binary digits in reverse order. This is done using the join method, which concatenates the elements of the result list with an empty string in between. The [::-1] slicing notation is used to reverse the order of the elements.â€‹

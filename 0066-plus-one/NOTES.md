n = len(digits):

Store the length of the digits list in the variable n.

carry = 1:

Initialize the carry variable to 1, as we are incrementing the number by one.
Iterating through the digits in reverse order:

The loop goes through each digit in reverse order (from right to left) using the range(n - 1, -1, -1) loop construct.

digits[i] += carry:

Increment the current digit by the value of the carry.

carry = digits[i] // 10:

Calculate the new value of the carry by dividing the updated digit by 10.

digits[i] %= 10:

Update the digit to its remainder after dividing by 10, effectively getting the new digit value.

if carry:

Check if there's still a carry left after iterating through all digits.

digits.insert(0, carry):

If there's a carry left, insert it at the beginning of the digits list.
Finally, the modified digits array is returned.

In summary, the code iterates through the digits in reverse order, incrementing each digit by the carry and calculating the new carry for the next iteration. It handles potential carryovers by updating the digits and inserting any remaining carry at the beginning if needed. This approach effectively increments the given integer represented as an array of digits.â€‹

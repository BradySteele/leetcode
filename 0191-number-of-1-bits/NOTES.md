binary = bin(n): This line converts the integer n into a binary string representation and assigns it to the variable binary. For example, if n is 5, binary will be set to the string '0b101' because the binary representation of 5 is '101'.

hamming = 0: This line initializes a variable hamming to 0. This variable will be used to keep track of the count of '1' bits in the binary representation of n.

for bit in binary:: This line starts a for loop that iterates over each character (bit) in the binary string. In each iteration, bit will represent the current character being examined.

if bit == '1':: This line checks if the current character bit is equal to the string '1'. In other words, it checks if the current bit in the binary representation is a '1'.

hamming += 1: If the current bit is indeed '1', this line increments the hamming count by 1. This step keeps track of the number of '1' bits encountered so far.

The for loop continues to iterate through each character in the binary string, repeating steps 4 and 5 for each bit.

After the for loop completes, the function hammingWeight returns the final value of hamming, which represents the count of '1' bits in the binary representation of the input integer n.

In summary, this code converts the integer to its binary representation, iterates through each bit in the binary string, counts the '1' bits encountered, and returns the count as the result.â€‹

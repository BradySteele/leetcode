SELECT email: This part of the query specifies that we want to select the email column from the Person table. We are interested in retrieving the email addresses of the duplicates.

FROM Person: We are selecting data from the Person table. This is the table that contains email addresses.

GROUP BY email: This line tells SQL to group the rows in the Person table based on the values in the email column. In other words, it creates groups of rows where the email addresses are the same.

HAVING COUNT(email) > 1: The HAVING clause is used to filter the groups created by GROUP BY. COUNT(email) calculates the number of occurrences of each email address within each group. HAVING COUNT(email) > 1 specifies that we want to include only those groups where the count of email addresses is greater than 1. This means we're looking for email addresses that occur more than once, indicating duplicates.

The final result: The query returns a list of email addresses that meet the condition of being duplicated. These are the email addresses that appear more than once in the Person table. The result will be in no specific order unless you explicitly specify an order using the ORDER BY clause, but in this case, the task does not require a specific order.â€‹

The function checks if n is less than or equal to 1 using the conditional statement. If n is indeed less than or equal to 1, it means there's only one or zero steps. In both cases, there's only one distinct way to climb the stairs. Therefore, the function returns 1.

The code initializes a list called combos with a length of (n + 1) and fills it with zeros. This list will be used to store the number of distinct ways to reach each step.

It sets the first two elements of the combos list (combos[0] and combos[1]) to 1. This is because there's only one way to reach step 0 and step 1, which is not taking any steps at all.

The code enters a loop that iterates from i = 2 to i = n. This loop calculates the number of distinct ways to reach each step from step 2 up to step n using dynamic programming.

Inside the loop, the value of combos[i] is calculated as the sum of the number of distinct ways to reach the previous step (i - 1) and the step before the previous (i - 2). This follows the idea of dynamic programming, where the number of ways to reach the current step depends on the number of ways to reach the previous steps.

After the loop completes, the function returns the value of combos[i], which represents the number of distinct ways to climb the staircase with n steps. Note that i holds the value of n + 1 after the loop, so combos[i] is equivalent to combos[n].
In summary, this code uses dynamic programming to calculate and return the number of distinct ways to climb a staircase with n steps. It initializes a list to store the number of ways for each step, iterates through the list to calculate the values dynamically, and finally returns the solution for the entire problem.â€‹

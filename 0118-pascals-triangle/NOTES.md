Input Validation:

The function generate takes an integer numRows as input, which represents the number of rows of Pascal's triangle to generate.
It starts with a check: if numRows is equal to 0, the function returns an empty list because there are no rows to generate.

Initialization:

A list called triangle is initialized to store the rows of Pascal's triangle. It's started with the first row containing a single element "1".
At this point, triangle looks like: triangle = [[1]].

Loop for Generating Rows:

A loop begins to generate the subsequent rows of the triangle.
Starting from i = 1 (the second row, since the first row is already initialized), the loop goes up to numRows - 1.
For each value of i, a new row is generated that will be appended to the triangle.

Loop for Generating Elements in a Row:

Within each iteration of the outer loop (for each row), an inner loop begins to generate the elements of that row.
The inner loop starts from j = 1 and continues up to i - 1. This covers the elements between the first and last "1" of the row.
For each value of j, an element of the current row is calculated based on the elements directly above it from the previous row.
This calculation involves adding the element at index j and the element at index j - 1 from the previous row (retrieved from the prevRow list).

Adding First and Last Elements:

After the inner loop completes, the element "1" is appended to the newRow. This corresponds to the last element of each row in Pascal's triangle.

Completing the Row:

The newRow list is now fully constructed, representing the current row of Pascal's triangle.
This newRow is added to the triangle list, which now contains one more row.

Returning the Result:

After all iterations of the outer loop, the function returns the triangle list, which holds the complete Pascal's triangle with numRows rows.

In summary, this code generates Pascal's triangle row by row. For each row, it calculates the elements based on the values directly above them in the previous row. The process repeats for the required number of rows, and the result is a list of lists representing Pascal's triangle. The outer loop controls the generation of rows, while the inner loop generates the elements within each row.

â€‹SELECT Statement: We start by defining the SELECT statement, which specifies the columns we want to retrieve from the tables.

Column Selection:

p.firstName: This selects the firstName column from the Person table, representing the first name of a person.

p.lastName: This selects the lastName column from the Person table, representing the last name of a person.

a.city: This selects the city column from the Address table, representing the city of a person.

a.state: This selects the state column from the Address table, representing the state of a person.

FROM Clause: We specify the tables from which we are retrieving data.

Person p: This aliases the Person table as p, making it easier to reference in the query.

Address a: This aliases the Address table as a, also for ease of reference.

LEFT JOIN Clause: This is the key part of the query. It combines data from both tables based on the personId column.

LEFT JOIN: This type of join ensures that all rows from the left table (Person) are included in the result, even if there are no matching rows in the right table (Address).

ON: This specifies the condition for the join. We join the tables where the personId column in both tables matches. This links each person in the Person table to their address in the Address table.

Result Set: The query retrieves data from both tables based on the join condition. Here's how it works:

For each person in the Person table (p), it tries to find a matching address in the Address table (a) based on the personId.
If a matching address is found, the city and state columns from the Address table are retrieved.
If no matching address is found (which is allowed by the LEFT JOIN), the city and state columns will contain NULL values.

Result Format: The result of the query is a table with columns for first name, last name, city, and state.

Each row corresponds to a person from the Person table.
If there's an address for a person, the city and state columns contain the corresponding values.
If there's no address (as indicated by the LEFT JOIN), the city and state columns will contain NULL values for that person.

Return: The query returns this result set, and the problem statement specifies that the order of the rows in the result doesn't matter.

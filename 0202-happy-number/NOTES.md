Initialize a Set: We start by initializing an empty set called seen. This set will be used to keep track of numbers encountered during the process to detect cycles.

Enter a While Loop: We enter a while loop that continues until we reach either of the two conditions:

If n becomes 1, we conclude that it's a happy number.
If we detect a cycle (i.e., we encounter a number that has been seen before), we conclude that it's not a happy number.
Convert n to a String: In each iteration of the loop, we convert the current value of n to a string. This allows us to iterate through its digits.

Iterate Through Digits and Square Them: For each digit in the string representation of n, we square the digit and sum up the squares to get the next value of n. For example, if n is 19, we square 1 and 9, and then sum the squares to get the next value of n.

Check for Cycle Detection: After computing the new value of n, we check if it's already in the seen set. If it is, we've encountered a number that we've seen before, indicating a cycle. In this case, we return False because it's not a happy number.

Add n to the Set: If n is not in the seen set, we add it to the set. This allows us to keep track of the numbers encountered so far.

Repeat or Exit Loop: We repeat the process by going back to the beginning of the while loop with the new value of n. We continue this process until one of the termination conditions is met.

Termination Conditions:

If we reach a point where n becomes 1, we break out of the loop because we've found a happy number.
If we encounter a number that is already in the seen set, we break out of the loop because we've detected a cycle, and it's not a happy number.
Return the Result: If we break out of the loop because n becomes 1, we return True to indicate that it's a happy number. If we break out of the loop because we detected a cycle, we return False to indicate that it's not a happy number.

In summary, this algorithm uses a while loop to repeatedly square the digits of n and check for cycles by maintaining a set of previously seen numbers. It continues until it either finds a happy number (when n becomes 1) or detects a cycle (when it encounters a number that has been seen before).

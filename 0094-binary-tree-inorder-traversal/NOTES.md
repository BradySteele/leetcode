The method inorderTraversal takes the root of a binary tree (root) as a parameter and returns a list of integers representing the inorder traversal.

An empty list result is initialized to store the traversal result.

An if statement checks if the root node is not None, indicating that there's a subtree to traverse.

If the root is not None, the recursion begins:

Left Subtree:

The code makes a recursive call to self.inorderTraversal(root.left). This step traverses the left subtree and appends the values of the nodes in the left subtree to the result list.

Current Node:

The value of the current node (root.val) is appended to the result list. This corresponds to visiting the current node in the inorder traversal.

Right Subtree:

The code makes a recursive call to self.inorderTraversal(root.right). This step traverses the right subtree and appends the values of the nodes in the right subtree to the result list.
After all recursive calls have completed, the result list contains the inorder traversal of the binary tree rooted at root.

The result list is returned as the final output of the inorderTraversal method.â€‹

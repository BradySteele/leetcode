The code enters a loop that iterates through each possible starting index in the haystack where a substring of the same length as the needle could potentially match.

The range for the loop is generated using range(len(haystack) - len(needle) + 1), ensuring that the loop does not exceed the point where the remaining part of haystack is shorter than the needle.

Within the loop, a substring is extracted from the haystack string using slicing: haystack[i:i+len(needle)].

The extracted substring is compared to the needle string using the equality operator (==). If they match, it indicates that the needle has been found within the haystack.

If a match is found, the loop is immediately exited using the return statement, and the index i is returned. This index represents the starting index of the substring in the haystack where the needle was found.

If the loop completes without finding any match, the function returns -1, indicating that the needle string was not found in the haystack.

This implementation effectively compares substrings of haystack with the needle string to determine whether a match exists. If a match is found, the index of the match is returned; otherwise, -1 is returned to indicate no match was found.â€‹

The removeElements function takes two arguments:

head: The head of a linked list.
val: An integer value to be removed from the linked list.
It starts by checking if the head is None, which would indicate an empty list. If the list is empty, it returns None because there are no nodes to remove.

It creates a dummy node with a value of 0. This dummy node is inserted at the beginning of the linked list and serves as a placeholder to simplify edge cases. The dummy.next initially points to the original head of the list.

It initializes a current pointer, initially pointing to the dummy node. This pointer is used to traverse the linked list.

It enters a while loop that iterates as long as there is a current.next node to examine. This loop iterates through the entire linked list.

Inside the loop, it checks if the value of the next node (current.next.val) is equal to the target value val.

If the value matches (current.next.val == val), it means that the current node should be removed. To remove it, it updates the current.next pointer to skip the current node and point directly to the node after the current one (current.next = current.next.next). This effectively removes the current node from the linked list.

If the value doesn't match (current.next.val != val), it means the current node should be retained. In this case, it moves the current pointer to the next node in the list (current = current.next).

The loop continues until it has examined all nodes in the linked list.

After the loop is complete, the dummy.next node represents the new head of the modified linked list. This is because the dummy node was inserted at the beginning, and its next pointer was updated as nodes were removed.

Finally, the function returns dummy.next as the new head of the linked list with all nodes containing the value val removed.

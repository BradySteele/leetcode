â€‹Roman Numeral Mapping (romanNumerals = {...}):

Initializes a dictionary named romanNumerals.
Maps each Roman numeral character to its corresponding integer value.

Initialize Total (total = 0):

Initializes a variable named total to store the accumulated integer value of the Roman numeral.

Calculate String Length (x = len(s)):

Calculates the length of the input Roman numeral string and assigns it to the variable x.

Loop Through Characters (for i in range(x - 1):):

Initiates a loop that iterates through the characters of the Roman numeral string up to the second-to-last character.
The loop variable i represents the index of the current character.

Compare Values (if romanNumerals[s[i]] < romanNumerals[s[i + 1]]:):

Compares the value of the current Roman numeral character with the value of the next character.
This comparison is used to determine whether subtractive notation is involved.

Subtractive Notation (total -= romanNumerals[s[i]]):

If the current character's value is less than the next character's value, it indicates subtractive notation (e.g., IV for 4).
The value of the current character is subtracted from the total.

Additive Notation (else:):

If the condition in the previous step is not satisfied, it means additive notation is used.
The value of the current character is added to the total.

Add Value of Last Character (total += romanNumerals[s[x - 1]]):

After the loop completes, the value of the last Roman numeral character is added to the total.

Return Total (return total):

The final total, representing the integer equivalent of the Roman numeral, is returned as the result of the function.
This code uses the provided mapping of Roman numeral characters to their integer values to convert a Roman numeral string to an integer. It iterates through the characters of the string, handling both subtractive and additive notation, and accumulates the integer value.

Check for Empty Input:

The first thing the code does is check if the list of strings strs is empty using the if not strs: condition.
If the list is empty, the function immediately returns an empty string "".

Find Shortest String:

The shortest string among the list of strings strs is found using the min() function. The reference to the shortest string is stored in the shortestString variable.

Initialize Prefix:

An empty string named prefix is initialized to store the common prefix.

Iterate Through Characters:

The code iterates through the characters of the shortestString using enumerate(shortestString).
For each character char at index i:
A nested loop iterates through each string in the strs list.
It compares the character char with the character at index i in each string.
If any character doesn't match, it means the common prefix ends here, so the current prefix is returned.

Add to Prefix:

If all characters match for the current position i in all strings, the character char is added to the prefix.

Return Common Prefix:

After the loop completes, the accumulated prefix contains the longest common prefix among the strings.
This prefix is returned as the final result of the function.
This code uses the shortest string as a reference for character-by-character comparison. If all characters match in the current position for all strings, the character is added to the prefix. If a mismatch is found, the function returns the current prefix. This approach effectively finds the longest common prefix among the given strings.â€‹

Check for Empty Lists:

The function starts by checking if either headA or headB is None. If either of them is None, it means one of the lists is empty, and there can be no intersection.
If either headA or headB is None, the function returns None to indicate that there is no intersection.

Initialize Pointers:

Two pointers, currA and currB, are initialized to the heads of headA and headB, respectively. These pointers will be used to traverse the two lists.

Traverse the Lists:

In a loop, the code checks if currA and currB are equal. If they are equal, it means the pointers have met at the intersection node, and the loop can be exited.

If they are not equal, the following steps are performed in each iteration:

a. Move currA to the next node: If currA is not None, it is moved to its next node (i.e., currA = currA.next).

b. Move currB to the next node: If currB is not None, it is moved to its next node (i.e., currB = currB.next).

These steps effectively move both pointers forward in their respective linked lists, bringing them closer to the intersection point.

Handling Different List Lengths:

If one of the pointers reaches the end of its respective list (i.e., becomes None), it is reset to the head of the other list.
This adjustment accounts for any length difference between the two linked lists.

Intersection Found or Not:

The loop continues until either an intersection node is found (i.e., currA == currB) or both pointers reach the end of their respective lists (i.e., both become None).
If an intersection is found, the pointers will meet at the intersection node.
If there is no intersection and both pointers become None, the loop will exit.

Return the Result:

Finally, the code returns the intersection node if found (the common node where currA and currB meet) or None if there is no intersection.
This approach efficiently finds the intersection point while handling cases with or without intersections and retains the original structure of both linked lists.

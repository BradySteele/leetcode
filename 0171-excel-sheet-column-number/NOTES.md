result = 0: This line initializes a variable result to store the final column number. It starts at 0 and will be gradually updated in the loop.

for i in range(len(columnTitle)):: This line sets up a for loop that iterates through each character in the columnTitle string. The loop variable i represents the position of the character in the string, starting from 0 and going up to the length of the string minus 1.

char = columnTitle[i]: Inside the loop, this line extracts the current character at position i in the columnTitle string and stores it in the variable char.

charValue = ord(char) - ord('A') + 1: This line calculates the numeric value of the current character. It does so by using the ord() function, which returns the ASCII value of a character. Here, it subtracts the ASCII value of 'A' from the ASCII value of char. This operation effectively converts 'A' to 1, 'B' to 2, and so on. Adding 1 ensures that 'A' corresponds to 1, 'B' to 2, and so forth.

power = len(columnTitle) - i - 1: This line calculates the exponent (power) to which 26 should be raised for the current character. It uses the length of the columnTitle string minus i minus 1. The reason for the subtraction of 1 is that the rightmost character corresponds to 26^0 (which is 1), the second rightmost character corresponds to 26^1 (which is 26), and so on.

result += charValue * (26 ** power): This line updates the result variable by adding the contribution of the current character to it. It does so by multiplying charValue (the numeric value of the character) by 26 raised to the power of power (the position of the character) and then adding this product to result. This step accumulates the total column number as you iterate through the characters.

The loop continues to the next character until all characters in columnTitle have been processed.

Finally, after the loop has finished, the function returns the result variable, which now contains the calculated column number.

In summary, this code processes each character in the columnTitle string, calculates its numeric value, determines its position in the column title, and accumulates the total column number by multiplying the numeric value with the appropriate power of 26 and adding it to the result. This effectively converts the Excel column title into a column number.â€‹

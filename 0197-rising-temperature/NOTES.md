Self-Join: We start with a self-join of the Weather table. A self-join is used when you want to join a table with itself. In this case, we create two aliases, Weather (representing the current date) and Yesterday (representing the previous date).

Comparison Based on Date Difference:

We use the DATEDIFF function to calculate the difference in days between the RecordDate of the current date and the RecordDate of the previous date. The expression DATEDIFF(Weather.RecordDate, Yesterday.RecordDate) computes the number of days between these two dates.
If the difference is 1, it means that the current date is one day after the previous date, which corresponds to yesterday's date.

Temperature Comparison:

Inside the WHERE clause, we compare the temperature of the current date (Weather.Temperature) with the temperature of the previous date (Yesterday.Temperature).
Specifically, we check if Weather.Temperature is greater than Yesterday.Temperature. This comparison ensures that we are selecting dates where the temperature increased compared to yesterday.

Selection of Dates' Id:

When the temperature comparison condition is met (current temperature is higher than yesterday), we select the Id of the current date.
This SELECT statement retrieves the Id of dates that have higher temperatures compared to their previous dates (yesterday).

Result:

The result of this query is a list of Id values representing the dates where the temperature increased compared to the previous day. These Id values are returned in the result set.
In summary, the SQL solution uses a self-join to compare each date with its previous date based on the RecordDate. It then selects the Id of dates where the temperature increased compared to yesterday and returns them as the final result.â€‹

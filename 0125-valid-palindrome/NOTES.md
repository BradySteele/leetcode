Removing Non-Alphanumeric Characters and Converting to Lowercase:

i = re.sub(r'[\W_]', '', s.lower()): This line of code performs two operations on the input string s:
s.lower(): It converts s to lowercase to make the palindrome check case-insensitive.

re.sub(r'[\W_]', '', ...): It uses regular expressions to substitute (replace) any non-alphanumeric characters (including underscores) in the string with an empty string, effectively removing them. The result is stored in the variable i.

The 'r' before the regular expression pattern '[\W_]' indicates that the string should be treated as a raw string. It's not strictly required for this specific pattern because there are no escape sequences in it. However, it's a good practice to use 'r' as a habit because it ensures that any special characters or escape sequences within the pattern are treated as literal characters and not interpreted differently by Python.

So, while it's not strictly necessary for this specific regular expression, using 'r' with regular expressions is a best practice to avoid unexpected behavior in more complex patterns.

Checking if the Modified String is a Palindrome:

return i == i[::-1]:
This line compares the modified string i with its reverse (i[::-1]). If they are equal, it means that the original string s is a palindrome, so the method returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.â€‹

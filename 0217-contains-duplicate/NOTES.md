Inside the containsDuplicate method, we create an empty set called seen. A set is a data structure that stores unique elements, and it's very efficient for checking for the existence of an element.

We then enter a loop that iterates through each element (num) in the input list nums. We'll perform the following steps for each element in the list.

Inside the loop, we check if the current element (num) is already in the seen set using the in keyword. If it is, this means we've encountered a duplicate, so we immediately return True to indicate that duplicates exist in the input list.

If the current element (num) is not in the seen set, we add it to the set using the add method. This effectively keeps track of the unique elements we've encountered so far.

We continue this process for each element in the nums list, and if we haven't found any duplicates after iterating through the entire list, we exit the loop.

After the loop, if we haven't returned True earlier (which would have happened if we found a duplicate), we return False. This indicates that there are no duplicates in the input list, and all elements are distinct.

In summary, this code efficiently uses a set to keep track of unique elements while iterating through the input list. If it ever encounters an element that is already in the set, it returns True to indicate the presence of duplicates. If it successfully iterates through the entire list without finding any duplicates, it returns False to indicate that all elements are distinct.â€‹

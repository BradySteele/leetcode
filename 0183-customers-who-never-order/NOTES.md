SELECT c.name AS Customers: We start by selecting the name column from the Customers table. We also use the AS Customers alias to rename this column as "Customers," which is the expected output format.

FROM Customers c: We specify that we are selecting data from the Customers table and give it an alias c.

LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.id = o.customerId: We perform a LEFT JOIN operation. This means we are combining the Customers table (c) with the Orders table (o) based on the condition that c.id (customer's ID) should match o.customerId (customer ID in orders). This join links customers to their orders, and it includes all customers even if they have no matching orders (hence the "LEFT" join).

WHERE o.id IS NULL: We add a filter condition to the joined data. Specifically, we check if the id column from the Orders table (o.id) is NULL. If it is NULL, it means there is no matching order for that customer, indicating that they have never placed an order.

The final result: The query returns a list of customer names who meet the condition of not having any matching orders. These are the customers who have never ordered anything. The result is in the expected output format, with the column name "Customers" and the customer names listed. The order of the result does not matter; it can be in any order.

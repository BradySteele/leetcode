​Initialization:

Initialize a variable k to 0. This variable will be used to keep track of the current index in the list.

Loop through the List:

Enter a while loop that iterates as long as k is less than the length of the nums list. This loop will go through each element in the list.

Element Comparison and Removal:

Inside the loop, check if the current element at index k is equal to the given value val.

If the current element is equal to val:
Use the pop() method to remove the element at index k. This effectively removes the current element from the list.
It's important to note that when an element is removed at index k, the subsequent elements shift one position to the left to fill the gap created by the removal.

If the current element is not equal to val:
Increment the value of k by 1. This moves the index k to the next element in the list, effectively skipping the current element since it's not equal to val.

Returning the Result:

After the loop completes, return the length of the modified nums list. This length represents the number of elements in the list that are not equal to the given value val.
The elements that were equal to val have been removed from the list, and the list now contains only elements that are not equal to val.​

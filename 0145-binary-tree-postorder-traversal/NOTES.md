Check for an Empty Tree:

The function starts by checking if the root node is None, which indicates an empty tree.
If the root is None, the function returns an empty list because there are no nodes to traverse.

Initialize the Result List:

An empty list called result is created. This list will store the values of nodes in the order they are visited during the postorder traversal.

Recursively Traverse the Left Subtree:

The code recursively calls the postorderTraversal function on the left subtree (i.e., root.left).
This recursive call performs a postorder traversal on the left subtree, ensuring that all nodes in the left subtree are visited before continuing.

Recursively Traverse the Right Subtree:

After completing the traversal of the left subtree, the code recursively calls the postorderTraversal function on the right subtree (i.e., root.right).
This recursive call performs a postorder traversal on the right subtree, ensuring that all nodes in the right subtree are visited before continuing.

Visit the Current Node (Root):

Once both the left and right subtrees have been traversed, the code visits the current node (the root of the current subtree).
The value of the current node is appended to the result list, effectively recording the order in which nodes are visited in the postorder traversal.

Return the Final Result:

The recursive calls continue until all nodes in the tree have been visited in postorder traversal order.
The values of nodes are collected in the result list in the order they are encountered during the traversal.
Finally, the result list contains the values of all nodes in the tree in postorder traversal order, and it is returned as the final output of the function.

In summary, this code uses a recursive approach to perform a postorder traversal by exploring the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally visiting the current node. The values of nodes are stored in the result list in the order they are encountered during the traversal.â€‹

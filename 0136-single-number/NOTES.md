return reduce(xor, nums): This is where the actual computation takes place. Let's break it down further:

reduce: reduce is a function from the functools module in Python. It is used to apply a binary function (in this case, xor) cumulatively to the items of an iterable (in this case, the nums list), from left to right.

xor: xor is a binary operator (bitwise XOR) that takes two numbers and returns their XOR result. In this context, it's used to find the XOR of all the numbers in the nums list.

nums: This is the list of integers you want to find the single number in.

So, the reduce(xor, nums) line essentially applies the XOR operation to all the elements in the nums list one by one. Since XORing a number with itself results in 0 (e.g., x ^ x = 0), and XORing any number with 0 leaves it unchanged (e.g., x ^ 0 = x), the XOR operation will cancel out all pairs of identical numbers, leaving only the single number that appears once.

This solution has a linear runtime complexity because it processes each element in the nums list once and uses only constant extra space since it doesn't require any additional data structures.

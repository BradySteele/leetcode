Base Case Check: The first thing the method does is to check if the input list nums is empty (not nums). If it's empty, that means there are no elements left to create a subtree. In this case, the method returns None, indicating an empty subtree.

Midpoint Calculation: If the nums list is not empty, the midpoint index mid is calculated using integer division: len(nums) // 2. This index represents the root element of the current subtree.

Root Node Creation: A TreeNode object is created to represent the root of the current subtree. The value of the root node is set to nums[mid], which corresponds to the middle element of the sorted array. This element becomes the root of the subtree.

Left Subtree Construction: The code then recursively calls the sortedArrayToBST method to construct the left subtree of the current root. This is done by passing the portion of the nums list from the beginning up to index mid - 1. This ensures that the left subtree will be built from the elements to the left of the current root.

Right Subtree Construction: Similarly, the code recursively calls the sortedArrayToBST method to construct the right subtree of the current root. This time, the portion of the nums list from index mid + 1 to the end is passed. This ensures that the right subtree will be built from the elements to the right of the current root.

Linking Subtrees: After constructing the left and right subtrees, the left and right attributes of the root node are set to the roots of the left and right subtrees, respectively. This establishes the hierarchical structure of the binary search tree.

Returning Root: Finally, the method returns the root node of the current subtree. This root node, along with its linked left and right subtrees, effectively represents the entire balanced binary search tree.

In summary, this code uses a recursive approach to construct a balanced binary search tree from a sorted integer array. The recursion involves repeatedly dividing the array into smaller subarrays and constructing subtrees for each subarray. The process ensures that the tree remains balanced and follows the rules of a binary search tree.

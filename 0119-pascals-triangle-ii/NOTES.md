The if rowIndex == 0 condition is a check at the beginning. If the input rowIndex is 0, it means you want the first row of Pascal's triangle, which is just [1]. In this case, the function returns [1] immediately.

prevRow is a list that represents the previous row of Pascal's triangle. It's initialized with [1], which corresponds to the first row of the triangle.

The for loop is the heart of the algorithm. It iterates from 1 to rowIndex. The purpose of this loop is to calculate each row in Pascal's triangle up to the specified rowIndex.

nextRow is a list that represents the current row being calculated. It is initialized with [1] as the first element because each row in Pascal's triangle always starts with 1.

The nested for loop is used to calculate the middle elements of the current row. It iterates from 1 to i, where i represents the index of the current row.

Inside the nested loop, nextNum is calculated. This variable represents the value of the current element in the row. It's computed by adding two values from the prevRow list. Specifically, it adds the element at index j - 1 and the element at index j. These two values are taken from the previous row and correspond to the numbers directly above and above-left in Pascal's triangle.

After calculating nextNum, it's appended to the nextRow list. This process is repeated for all the middle elements in the current row.

After the nested loop completes, 1 is appended to the end of nextRow. This represents the last element of the current row because each row in Pascal's triangle ends with 1.

prevRow is updated with nextRow. This step is crucial because it prepares prevRow for the next iteration of the outer loop, where it will become the "previous row" for the next row calculation.

Finally, after the outer loop finishes, the function returns prevRow. prevRow now contains the row at the desired rowIndex, and this row represents the result of the function.â€‹

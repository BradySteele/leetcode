SELECT e1.name AS Employee: This part of the query specifies that we want to select the name column from the Employee table and give it the alias Employee. This will be the name of the employees who earn more than their managers in the result.

FROM Employee e1: We are selecting data from the Employee table and giving it an alias e1. This is the table that represents the employees.

JOIN Employee e2 ON e1.managerId = e2.id: This line performs a join operation. It combines the Employee table (e1) with itself (e2) based on a common condition. Here, we are matching employees (e1) with their managers (e2) by comparing the managerId in e1 with the id in e2. This creates a relationship between employees and their managers.

WHERE e1.salary > e2.salary: This is a filter condition that specifies that we want to include only those rows where the salary of the employee (e1.salary) is greater than the salary of their manager (e2.salary). This condition ensures that we're only selecting employees who earn more than their managers.

The final result: The query returns a list of employee names (aliased as Employee) who meet the criteria of earning more than their managers. These names are the employees who earn more than their managers. The result will be in no specific order unless you explicitly specify an order using the ORDER BY clause.â€‹

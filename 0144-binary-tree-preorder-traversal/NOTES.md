Check for an Empty Tree:

The function starts by checking if the root node is None (which means the tree is empty).
If the root is None, there are no nodes to traverse, so we return an empty list as the result.

Initialize the Result List:

We create an empty list called result. This list will store the values of nodes in the order they are traversed during the preorder traversal.

Visit the Current Node (Root):

In a preorder traversal, we start by visiting the current node (the root).
We add the value of the root node to the result list.

Recursively Traverse the Left Subtree:

After visiting the root node, we recursively call the preorderTraversal function on the left subtree (i.e., root.left).
This recursive call follows the same preorder traversal process for the left subtree, starting from its own root node.

Recursively Traverse the Right Subtree:

After completing the traversal of the left subtree, we recursively call the preorderTraversal function on the right subtree (i.e., root.right).
This recursive call follows the same preorder traversal process for the right subtree, starting from its own root node.

Return the Final Result:

The recursive calls continue until all nodes in the tree have been visited in a preorder traversal fashion.
The values of nodes are appended to the result list as they are visited.
Once the traversal is complete, the result list contains the values of all nodes in the tree in preorder traversal order.
We return this result list as the final output of the function.

In essence, this code recursively explores the tree, starting from the root and following the preorder traversal order: visit the current node, explore the left subtree, and then explore the right subtree. The values are collected in the result list in the order in which they are encountered during the traversal.

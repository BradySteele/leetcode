â€‹Method and Parameters: The given code is a method merge within a class named Solution. This method is intended to merge two sorted arrays, nums1 and nums2, in-place. The method takes four parameters:

nums1: A list of integers where the merged result will be stored.

m: An integer representing the number of elements in nums1 that need to be considered for merging.

nums2: A list of integers representing the second sorted array to be merged into nums1.

n: An integer representing the number of elements in nums2.

Pointer Initialization: The method initializes three pointers to keep track of positions in the arrays:

p1 starts at m - 1, pointing to the last element of the valid part of nums1.

p2 starts at n - 1, pointing to the last element of nums2.

p starts at (m + n) - 1, indicating the last available position in the merged array.

Merging Process:

The code uses a while loop to perform the merging process. The loop continues until there are no elements left in nums2 (i.e., p2 is greater than or equal to 0).

Comparison and Placement:

If the element at position p1 in nums1 is greater than the element at position p2 in nums2, it means that the next element to be placed in the merged array should come from nums1. The element at position p1 in nums1 is placed at the position p in the merged array nums1, which is the correct place for the largest of the two elements. The p1 pointer is then decremented by 1 to move to the previous element in nums1.
If the element at position p1 in nums1 is not greater than the element at position p2 in nums2, or if all elements from nums1 have already been placed in the merged array, the next element to be placed in the merged array should come from nums2. The element at position p2 in nums2 is placed at the position p in the merged array nums1, which is the correct place for the largest of the two elements. The p2 pointer is then decremented by 1 to move to the previous element in nums2.

Pointer Movement:

After placing an element in the merged array, the p pointer is decremented by 1 to move to the previous position in the merged array.

Post-Loop: After the while loop completes, all elements from nums2 have been merged into the merged array nums1 in their correct positions.

Remaining Elements from nums1: If there are any remaining elements in nums1 that were not considered during the merging process (i.e., p1 is still greater than or equal to 0), these elements are already in their correct positions and do not need to be modified.

Final Result: The method modifies the original nums1 array in-place to contain the merged and sorted elements from both nums1 and nums2.

Return Value: The method doesn't return anything, as it directly modifies nums1 in-place, which aligns with the requirement of the problem statement.

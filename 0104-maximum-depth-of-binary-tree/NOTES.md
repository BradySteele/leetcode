Step 1: Base Case Check

The function maxDepth takes the root node of the binary tree as input.
It starts by checking if the root is None, which would mean it's a leaf node with no children.
If the root is None, the function immediately returns 0, as the depth of a leaf node is 0.

Step 2: Left Subtree Depth Calculation

If the root is not None, the function recursively calculates the maximum depth of the left subtree by calling self.maxDepth(root.left).
This step drills down into the left subtree, applying the same process.

Step 3: Right Subtree Depth Calculation

Similarly, the function calculates the maximum depth of the right subtree by calling self.maxDepth(root.right).
This step drills down into the right subtree, applying the same process.

Step 4: Combining Depths

After calculating the maximum depths of both the left and right subtrees, the function returns the larger of the two depths plus 1.
The max() function compares the depths and returns the greater value, representing the maximum depth of the current tree.
Adding 1 accounts for the depth of the current level (root node).

In summary, this code uses a recursive approach to traverse the binary tree and compute the maximum depth. It leverages the fact that the depth of a tree is the maximum depth between its left and right subtrees plus 1. The base case handles leaf nodes, and the recursive calls handle the traversal and computation of depths for subtrees. The final result is the maximum depth of the entire binary tree.â€‹

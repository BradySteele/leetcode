Initialize a variable result to store the reversed bits. This variable starts at 0.

Start a loop that will run 32 times. This loop will reverse the bits of the input integer n.

In this specific loop, the variable _ is used to iterate 32 times, but the value of the iteration variable is not needed inside the loop body. The purpose of the loop is to reverse the bits of the input integer, and it doesn't require tracking the current iteration index. So, _ is used as a placeholder for the iteration index to indicate that it's not going to be used in the loop's operations.

You could use any variable name in place of _, like i, and it would work the same way. However, using _ is a common convention when the loop variable is not going to be used, and it makes the code more readable by indicating the variable's lack of importance in this context.

Inside the loop:

Left shift result by one bit to make room for the next bit. The << operator shifts the bits of result one position to the left, effectively multiplying it by 2.
Use a bitwise OR | operation to set the rightmost bit of result. This bit is determined by n & 1. The & operator performs a bitwise AND between n and 1, which isolates the rightmost bit of n. Then, the result is combined with result using bitwise OR to set the corresponding bit in result.
Right shift n by one bit to move to the next bit. The >> operator shifts the bits of n one position to the right, effectively dividing it by 2.
Repeat the steps inside the loop 32 times, effectively reversing all 32 bits of the input integer n.

After the loop completes, result will contain the reversed bits of the input integer.

Finally, return result, which now holds the 32-bit integer with its bits reversed.

In summary, this code iterates through each bit of the input integer n, extracts the rightmost bit, and appends it to the result by shifting and using bitwise OR operations. This process is repeated 32 times to reverse all 32 bits of the input integer.

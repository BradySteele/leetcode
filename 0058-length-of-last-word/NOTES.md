String Splitting:

The code starts by splitting the input string s into a list of words using the split() method.
The split() method without any arguments splits the string at spaces by default.
The resulting words are stored in the words list.

Check for Non-Empty List:

The code then checks if the words list is non-empty using an if statement.

Accessing Last Word:

If the words list is non-empty, the code proceeds to the next step.
The last word is accessed from the words list using negative indexing (words[-1]).
The variable lastWord holds the value of the last word.

Returning the Length:

Finally, the code returns the length of the lastWord using the len() function.
This length represents the length of the last word in the input string.

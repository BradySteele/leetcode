Initial Check: The code starts with a check to see if the prices list is empty (if not prices:). If the list is empty, it means there are no prices to consider, so the function returns 0, indicating that zero profit can be made in this case.

Initialization: Two variables are initialized:

max_profit: This variable is used to keep track of the maximum profit that can be obtained. It is initialized to 0 because no profit has been made yet.

min_price: This variable is used to keep track of the minimum price seen so far. It is initialized with the first price in the prices list (prices[0]).

Loop Through Prices: The code enters a for loop that iterates through the prices in the prices list, starting from the second price (index 1) and going to the end of the list. This is accomplished using for i in prices[1:]:.

Update Maximum Profit: Inside the loop, the code calculates the profit that can be obtained by selling at the current price (i - min_price). It then updates max_profit with the maximum value between the current max_profit and the calculated profit. This ensures that max_profit always holds the maximum profit seen so far.

Update Minimum Price: After calculating the profit, the code also updates min_price by taking the minimum value between the current min_price and the current price (min(min_price, i)). This ensures that min_price always holds the minimum price seen so far.

Loop Continues: The loop continues to iterate through the remaining prices, updating max_profit and min_price as necessary.

Return Maximum Profit: After the loop finishes, the function returns the final value of max_profit, which represents the maximum profit that can be obtained from the given list of stock prices.

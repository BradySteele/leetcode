The base case: if not root, which checks if the current node is None (i.e., the tree is empty). If root is None, it returns 0 because there are no nodes in an empty tree.

The recursive case: When root is not None, it calculates the count of nodes as follows:

1: This adds 1 to the count for the current node. Every non-empty node is counted once.
self.countNodes(root.right): This recursively counts the nodes in the right subtree of the current node. It calls the countNodes method on the right subtree.

self.countNodes(root.left): Similarly, this recursively counts the nodes in the left subtree of the current node.
The total count is obtained by summing up the counts of the current node, its right subtree, and its left subtree. This is accomplished by using the + operator.

The result is returned as the count of nodes in the binary tree.

The recursion here continues until it reaches the base case (when root becomes None), at which point it starts returning 0 for each None node in the tree. As it backtracks and adds up the counts for each non-empty node, it effectively counts all the nodes in the binary tree.

This solution provides an O(n) time complexity since it needs to visit every node in the binary tree exactly once, where 'n' is the number of nodes in the tree.â€‹
